## ARTICLE 2: AGREEMENT FORMATION AND ACCEPTANCE

### 2.1 Offer and Acceptance

This Agreement constitutes Provider's offer to license access to the Service to User under the terms and conditions specified herein. User's acceptance of this offer, and the resulting formation of a binding contract, occurs through the acceptance mechanism described in Section 2.2 below.

Provider reserves the unilateral right to refuse service to any prospective User, to reject any account registration application, or to decline to enter into this Agreement with any party, for any reason or no reason, with or without explanation, in Provider's sole and absolute discretion. No binding contract is formed until Provider affirmatively accepts User's acceptance through the mechanisms described herein, typically by issuing API credentials and granting access to the Service.

### 2.2 Mechanism of Acceptance

User manifests acceptance of this Agreement, thereby forming a binding contract with Provider, through any one or more of the following actions:

(a) **Explicit Acceptance During Registration**: By completing the account registration process on the Service website or application, including checking the checkbox or clicking the button labeled "I Accept the Terms of Service" (or substantially similar language), User explicitly manifests assent to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety.

(b) **Payment Submission**: By submitting payment for Credits or completing any financial transaction with Provider, User acknowledges that such payment constitutes acceptance of this Agreement and represents User's intent to be contractually bound to its terms, irrespective of whether User has separately clicked an acceptance button.

(c) **Service Usage**: By accessing any API endpoint, making any API request, using any API Key, or otherwise utilizing the Service in any manner, User manifests acceptance of this Agreement through conduct. Continued use after any modification of Terms (as provided in Article 19) constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

(d) **Account Activity**: By logging into the User dashboard, modifying Account settings, viewing documentation, or engaging in any other Account-related activity, User reaffirms acceptance of this Agreement.

### 2.3 Electronic Acceptance and Digital Signature Equivalence

User acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) This Agreement is an electronic contract formed through electronic means, and User's electronic acceptance (as described in Section 2.2) constitutes a legally binding signature equivalent to a handwritten signature under applicable electronic commerce laws, including but not limited to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce and Uzbekistan Law on Electronic Digital Signature.

(b) User expressly waives any rights or requirements under any statute, regulation, rule, ordinance, or other law requiring an original (non-electronic) signature or requiring delivery or retention of non-electronic records.

(c) User consents to the electronic formation, delivery, storage, and retention of this Agreement and agrees that this electronic format shall constitute the definitive and authoritative version of this Agreement.

### 2.4 Recorded Acceptance Metadata

At the moment of acceptance (as defined in Section 2.2), Provider's systems automatically collect and permanently record the following Acceptance Metadata:

(a) **Temporal Data**: Precise timestamp of acceptance event (recorded in UTC to millisecond precision), including date, hour, minute, and second;

(b) **Network Data**: User's public IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), autonomous system number (ASN), Internet service provider information, and estimated geographic location (country, region, city) derived from IP geolocation databases;

(c) **Device Data**: Complete device fingerprint as defined in Article 1.1, including user agent string, browser type and version, operating system and version, screen resolution and color depth, timezone offset, installed plugins, WebGL renderer, canvas fingerprint hash, and audio context fingerprint;

(d) **Document Version**: The specific version number of this Agreement that User accepted (e.g., "Version 3.0"), including the Last Modified date displayed at the time of acceptance;

(e) **Acceptance Method**: The specific mechanism through which acceptance occurred (e.g., "registration checkbox", "payment submission", "first API call"), including details such as button clicked, form submitted, or endpoint accessed;

(f) **Account Identifiers**: User's email address, assigned Account ID, and any other identifiers associated with User's Account at time of acceptance.

This Acceptance Metadata serves multiple critical functions:

(i) It constitutes evidence that User knowingly and voluntarily entered into this Agreement, thereby negating any subsequent claim of non-acceptance, lack of awareness, or absence of intent to be bound;

(ii) It establishes the specific version of Terms that govern User's Account, which is essential in cases where Terms have been modified over time;

(iii) It facilitates fraud detection and prevention by enabling Provider to detect patterns of abuse such as mass account creation from the same device or network;

(iv) It provides evidentiary material for dispute resolution, payment disputes, chargeback contestation, and potential legal proceedings.

Provider shall retain Acceptance Metadata for the duration of User's Account lifecycle plus a minimum of seven (7) years thereafter for legal, regulatory, and evidentiary purposes, notwithstanding any Account deletion or data minimization requests, except where prohibited by mandatory law.

### 2.5 Legal Capacity and Authority

By accepting this Agreement, User represents, warrants, and covenants that:

(a) **Age Requirement**: User is at least thirteen (13) years of age if located outside the European Union, or at least sixteen (16) years of age if located within the European Union, or has reached the age of majority in User's jurisdiction, whichever is greater. Users below the age of majority in their jurisdiction represent that they have obtained verifiable parental or legal guardian consent to enter into this Agreement.

(b) **Legal Capacity**: User possesses the full legal capacity and authority to enter into contracts under the laws applicable to User. User is not subject to any legal disability, restriction, or incapacity that would prevent User from being bound by this Agreement.

(d) **No Conflicts**: User's entry into and performance of this Agreement does not violate any other agreement to which User is a party, any court order or judgment, any applicable law or regulation, or any fiduciary or other duty owed to any third party.

(e) **Sanctions Compliance**: User is not, and is not acting on behalf of, any person or entity that is: (i) subject to economic sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union, United Nations, or Republic of Uzbekistan; (ii) located in, resident of, or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive economic sanctions; or (iii) listed on any sanctions-related list of designated persons maintained by sanctioning authorities.

Provider may, in its sole discretion, require User to provide documentary evidence of any representation made in this Section 2.5, including but not limited to: government-issued identification, proof of parental consent, corporate formation documents, authorizing resolutions, or sanctions compliance certificates. Failure to provide requested documentation within fifteen (15) days of request shall constitute grounds for immediate Account suspension or termination.

### 2.6 Modification of Acceptance

## ARTICLE 5: PAYMENT TERMS, BILLING, AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

### 5.1 Service Fee Structure and Pricing Model

The Service operates exclusively on a prepaid, pay-as-you-go basis. There are no subscriptions, no automatic renewals, no recurring charges, and no post-paid billing arrangements. User purchases Credits in advance, and each API request deducts one (1) Credit from User's Account balance at the time the request is processed.

As of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Standard Pricing Rate is **One Thousand Credits for One United States Dollar (1,000 Credits = US$1.00)**, which equates to **One Tenth of One Cent per API Request ($0.001 per request)**.

Provider expressly reserves the absolute and unilateral right to modify, adjust, increase, or decrease the Standard Pricing Rate at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without prior notice to User, subject to the protections afforded to Purchased Credits as described in Section 5.2.

### 5.2 Treatment of Purchased Credits Upon Price Changes

Notwithstanding Provider's right to change pricing at any time pursuant to Section 5.1, the following protections apply to Credits that User has already purchased prior to any price change:

(a) **Grandfathered Value**: All Credits purchased by User prior to a price increase shall retain their original value and functionality. A price increase shall not diminish the purchasing power of pre-existing Credits, devalue them, or alter the 1:1 ratio of Credits to API requests.

(b) **No Retroactive Application**: Price increases apply **only** to new Credit purchases made after the price change effective date. Provider shall not retroactively charge User additional amounts for Credits previously purchased at lower rates.

(c) **No Refund for Price Decreases**: Conversely, if Provider decreases prices, User is not entitled to any refund, credit adjustment, or compensation for Credits purchased at the previous higher rate. Price decreases similarly apply only to future purchases.

(d) **Communication of Price Changes**: Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of material price increases (defined as increases exceeding 20% of the current rate) through one or more of the following methods: (i) email to User's registered email address; (ii) prominent notice displayed on the User dashboard; (iii) notice published on the Service website; or (iv) notice included in Provider's regular communications. However, **failure to provide advance notice does not invalidate a price change**, and User's continued purchase of Credits after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.

(e) **Price Lock Not Guaranteed**: This Agreement does not guarantee any fixed pricing for any duration. User acknowledges that pricing for digital services is subject to change based on market conditions, operational costs, currency fluctuations, and business considerations.

### 5.3 Minimum Purchase Requirements

Provider may impose minimum purchase requirements from time to time. As of the Effective Date, the minimum Credit purchase is Five United States Dollars ($5.00), equivalent to Five Thousand (5,000) Credits. Provider may modify this minimum at any time in its sole discretion.

There is no maximum purchase limit unless otherwise specified by Provider or imposed by payment processor limitations.

### 5.4 Accepted Payment Methods

Provider currently accepts payments via the following Payment Methods:

(a) **Cryptocurrency**: Tether (USDT) on TRC-20 network, USD Coin (USDC), Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies as designated on the Service payment page;

(b) **Payment Cards**: Credit cards and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) processed through Stripe, Inc. or other designated payment processors;

(c) **Additional Methods**: Other payment methods as Provider may designate from time to time through the payment interface.

Provider reserves the right to add, modify, or discontinue any Payment Method at any time without notice. Provider may impose different minimum purchase amounts, processing fees, or restrictions based on Payment Method selected.

**Provider Does Not Store Payment Information**: Provider does not collect, process, or store User's payment card numbers, card verification values (CVV), bank account information, or cryptocurrency private keys. All payment processing is handled by third-party payment processors operating under their own terms of service and privacy policies. User's provision of payment information to such processors is subject to such processors' terms and policies, not this Agreement.

### 5.5 Payment Processing and Credit Issuance

Upon User's submission of payment:

(a) **Authorization and Verification**: Payment is first authorized and verified by the payment processor. This may include fraud checks, card verification, cryptocurrency transaction confirmation, or other security measures implemented by the processor.

(b) **Credit Issuance**: Upon successful payment authorization and Provider's receipt of payment confirmation from the processor, Credits are immediately and automatically issued to User's Account. The quantity of Credits issued is calculated based on the amount paid and the then-current pricing rate.

(c) **Transaction Record Creation**: Provider simultaneously creates a Transaction Record (as defined in Article 1.1) containing all relevant transaction metadata, which serves as proof that service has been delivered.

(d) **Delivery Constitutes Performance**: For purposes of determining whether Provider has performed its obligations and delivered the service to User, **the issuance of Credits to User's Account constitutes complete and irrevocable delivery of digital services**. Upon Credit issuance, Provider's performance obligation is fully satisfied, and User has received the complete benefit of the transaction.

(e) **No Delivery Delay Claims**: User acknowledges that Credit issuance is typically instantaneous (within seconds or minutes of payment confirmation) and waives any claims related to delayed delivery, provided Credits are issued within twenty-four (24) hours of payment confirmation.

### 5.6 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON REFUNDS

**ALL SALES ARE FINAL. ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**

This Section 5.6 constitutes User's express, knowing, and voluntary waiver of any right to a refund or credit for any reason whatsoever. By accepting this Agreement and by completing any payment transaction, User specifically and unequivocally acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) **Nature of Digital Goods**: The Service constitutes a digital good that is delivered instantaneously upon payment. Unlike physical goods that can be returned, digital services that have been delivered cannot be "returned" or "undelivered." Credits issued to User's Account represent access to a digital service that has been irrevocably granted.

(b) **Service Delivered Upon Credit Issuance**: The moment Credits are issued to User's Account, the service has been fully and completely delivered. The issuance of Credits constitutes delivery of the digital service that User purchased. Provider's performance obligation is thereby fully satisfied.

(c) **Comprehensive and Unconditional No-Refund Policy**: User shall not be entitled to any refund, chargeback, credit adjustment, reversal, or return under any circumstances, including but not limited to the following:

(i) **Change of Mind**: User's subsequent regret, change of mind, buyer's remorse, or decision that User no longer wants or needs the Service;

(ii) **Unused Credits**: User's failure to use purchased Credits, regardless of reason. Credits remain valid indefinitely (subject to Account inactivity provisions in Article 6) but are never refundable merely because they remain unused;

(iii) **Service Dissatisfaction**: User's dissatisfaction with the Service, including dissatisfaction with Content quality, accuracy, completeness, API performance, response times, or any other aspect of service quality;

(iv) **Service Availability Issues**: Service downtime, interruptions, outages, maintenance periods, degraded performance, or unavailability, whether scheduled or unscheduled, brief or prolonged;

(v) **Feature Changes**: Provider's modification, addition, removal, or discontinuation of any Service features or functionality;

(vi) **Technical Incompatibility**: User's inability to integrate with the Service due to technical limitations, incompatibility with User's systems, lack of technical expertise, or any other technical reason;

(vii) **Misunderstanding**: User's misunderstanding of how the Service works, what the Service provides, pricing structure, rate limits, or any other Service aspect, even if such misunderstanding was reasonable;

(viii) **Third-Party Issues**: Issues with User's payment processor, User's bank or financial institution, User's internet connectivity, or any other third-party service that impacts User's ability to use the Service;

(ix) **Force Majeure Events**: Service unavailability due to Force Majeure Events (as defined in Article 1.1 and detailed in Article 13.6);

(x) **Account Termination or Suspension**: Termination or suspension of User's Account for any reason, including but not limited to User's breach of this Agreement, Prohibited Uses, or Provider's voluntary cessation of business operations;

(xi) **Legal or Regulatory Compliance**: Provider's compliance with court orders, subpoenas, law enforcement requests, or regulatory requirements that necessitate Account restrictions or Service limitations;

(xii) **Error in Purchase**: User's accidental purchase of incorrect Credit amount, duplicate purchases, or purchases made in error;

(xiii) **Financial Hardship**: User's subsequent financial difficulties, inability to afford continued use, business failure, or personal economic circumstances;

(xiv) **Competitive Services**: User's discovery of alternative services, competing APIs, or better pricing from other providers;

(xv) **Any Other Reason**: Any and all other reasons, circumstances, or justifications not specifically enumerated above.

The foregoing list is illustrative and non-exhaustive. User unconditionally waives all refund rights and agrees that no circumstance, event, or reason shall entitle User to a refund.

(d) **Waiver of Statutory and Common Law Refund Rights**: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, User waives any rights to refunds, cancellations, or rescission that may exist under statutory consumer protection laws, distance selling regulations, cooling-off period provisions, or common law principles of contract rescission. User acknowledges that User is waiving potentially valuable legal rights by agreeing to this no-refund policy.

(e) **No Implied Refund Rights**: No statement, representation, or conduct by Provider or its employees, contractors, or agents shall create any implied right to a refund. All refund rights are exclusively governed by this Section 5.6, which categorically prohibits refunds.

(f) **Inapplicability to Mandatory Law Refund Rights**: Notwithstanding the absolute nature of this no-refund policy, User retains any refund rights that exist under mandatory laws of User's jurisdiction that cannot be waived by contract. For example, certain European Union consumer protection directives may grant limited refund rights that cannot be contractually waived. However, User acknowledges that such mandatory law exceptions are narrow and that User bears the burden of establishing entitlement to such exception.

(g) **Exception for Material Terms Modification**: The sole exception to this no-refund policy is described in Article 19.4, whereby User may request a refund of unused Credits within thirty (30) days of notification of a material adverse modification to this Agreement, provided User has not used any Credits since receiving such notification and User terminates User's Account in connection with the refund request. This exception is narrow and subject to strict procedural requirements as specified in Article 19.4.

### 5.7 Chargebacks Constitute Fraudulent Conduct

**User expressly acknowledges and agrees that initiating a chargeback or payment dispute for any transaction where Provider has delivered the service (i.e., issued Credits to User's Account) constitutes theft of services, fraud, and a material breach of this Agreement.**

A "chargeback" for purposes of this Agreement includes any of the following:

(a) A payment reversal initiated by User with User's payment card issuer, bank, or financial institution;

(b) A payment dispute filed with User's payment processor or gateway (e.g., PayPal dispute, Stripe dispute);

(c) A cryptocurrency transaction reversal attempt or double-spend attack;

(d) Any other mechanism by which User seeks to reverse, cancel, or obtain a refund for a completed payment transaction.

**Legitimate Unauthorized Transaction Exception**: The foregoing does not apply to chargebacks initiated due to genuinely unauthorized transactions where User's payment credentials were stolen and used by a third party without User's knowledge or authorization. In such cases, User must:

(i) Report the unauthorized transaction to Provider within forty-eight (48) hours of discovering it by emailing security@mumin.ink;

(ii) Provide Provider with documentation supporting the claim of unauthorized use, including police reports, fraud affidavits, or other evidence reasonably requested by Provider;

(iii) Cooperate fully with Provider's investigation, including providing additional documentation and answering questions;

(iv) Not use the Account or any Credits obtained through the disputed transaction during the investigation period.

If Provider determines, in its reasonable discretion based on the evidence provided, that the transaction was genuinely unauthorized, Provider will work with User and the payment processor to resolve the matter fairly. However, if Provider's investigation reveals evidence suggesting the transaction was authorized by User, the chargeback shall be treated as fraudulent conduct under this Section 5.7.

**Consequences of Fraudulent Chargebacks**: If User initiates a chargeback that Provider reasonably determines to be fraudulent (i.e., for services that were properly delivered), Provider shall take the following actions:

(a) **Immediate Account Termination**: User's Account shall be immediately and permanently terminated. All API Keys shall be revoked instantly, and User shall be prohibited from accessing the Service. User shall not be permitted to create any new Accounts in the future.

(b) **Forfeiture of Remaining Credits**: Any and all Credits remaining in User's Account at the time of chargeback initiation shall be immediately forfeited and become null and void. User shall have no claim to such Credits or their value.

(c) **Chargeback Contestation**: Provider shall contest the chargeback with the payment processor or card issuer by submitting comprehensive evidence of service delivery, including but not limited to:

(i) Transaction Records showing payment date, amount, and transaction ID;

(ii) Acceptance Metadata proving User's acceptance of this Agreement and its no-refund policy;

(iii) API usage logs demonstrating User's use of the Service after purchasing Credits;

(iv) Timestamps and IP addresses of User's Account activity and API requests;

(v) This Agreement, including this Section 5.7, which User explicitly accepted;

(vi) Any communications between User and Provider;

(vii) Device fingerprints and other fraud detection data;

(viii) Any other evidence relevant to establishing service delivery and User's bad faith.

Provider's evidence package is typically comprehensive and detailed, resulting in a high chargeback defense success rate. Users should be aware that payment processors and card issuers generally rule in favor of merchants when clear evidence of service delivery and customer agreement to no-refund terms is presented.

(d) **Legal Action for Damages**: Provider expressly reserves the right to pursue civil legal action against User to recover:

(i) The amount of the chargeback;

(ii) Any chargeback fees or penalties imposed on Provider by payment processors (typically $15-$100 per chargeback);

(iii) Costs incurred in contesting the chargeback, including staff time and administrative expenses;

(iv) Attorneys' fees and legal costs if Provider retains counsel;

(v) Any additional damages Provider suffers as a result of the fraudulent chargeback;

(vi) Punitive or exemplary damages, where permitted by applicable law.

(e) **Fraud Database Reporting**: Provider may report User's information (name, email, IP address, payment details) to fraud prevention databases and services (e.g., Ethoca, Verifi, Kount, Sift) to alert other merchants and payment processors about User's fraudulent conduct. This may impair User's ability to conduct transactions with other online services.

(f) **Criminal Referral**: In cases involving high-value chargebacks, repeated chargeback fraud, or other aggravating factors, Provider may refer the matter to law enforcement authorities for potential criminal prosecution. Chargeback fraud may constitute criminal theft, fraud, or computer fraud under various jurisdictions' laws.

(g) **Credit Bureau Reporting**: If Provider obtains a judgment against User in civil proceedings, such judgment may be reported to credit bureaus, negatively impacting User's credit score and creditworthiness.

**User's Acknowledgment**: By accepting this Agreement, User specifically acknowledges that:

(i) User has read and understood this Section 5.7 in its entirety;

(ii) User understands that chargebacks for delivered services constitute fraud;

(iii) User agrees not to initiate chargebacks except in cases of genuinely unauthorized transactions;

(iv) User understands the severe consequences that will result from fraudulent chargebacks;

(v) User has no excuse of ignorance or misunderstanding of the no-refund and no-chargeback policies.

### 5.8 Transaction Record Retention and Evidentiary Value

Provider maintains comprehensive Transaction Records (as defined in Article 1.1) for each payment transaction. These records serve multiple critical purposes:

(a) **Proof of Service Delivery**: Transaction Records constitute evidence that Provider delivered the service to User (by issuing Credits) and that User received the benefit of the transaction. This evidence is used to defend against chargebacks, payment disputes, and legal claims.

(b) **Tax and Accounting Compliance**: Transaction Records are retained for tax reporting, financial auditing, and regulatory compliance purposes.

(c) **Fraud Detection and Analysis**: Transaction Records are analyzed to detect patterns of fraudulent behavior, abuse, or suspicious activity.

(d) **Legal Proceedings**: Transaction Records may be produced as evidence in arbitration proceedings, court proceedings, or administrative proceedings relating to disputes with User.

Transaction Records are retained for a minimum of seven (7) years from the transaction date, which exceeds most jurisdictions' statutes of limitations for contract claims and aligns with typical tax authority audit periods. User consents to such retention and acknowledges that Provider may be legally required to retain records for such duration.

Transaction Records are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel. See Article 17 (Privacy and Data Protection) for additional information.

### 5.9 Taxes and Withholding

(a) **Exclusive of Taxes**: All prices and fees specified in this Agreement are exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments (collectively "Taxes"). User is solely responsible for all Taxes associated with User's purchase and use of the Service, except for taxes based on Provider's net income.

(b) **User's Obligation**: User shall pay all applicable Taxes arising from or relating to User's purchase of Credits or use of the Service. Such Taxes may include, without limitation: (i) sales tax; (ii) use tax; (iii) value-added tax (VAT); (iv) goods and services tax (GST); (v) withholding tax; (vi) consumption tax; or (vii) any other similar tax imposed by any jurisdiction.

(c) **VAT for EU Users**: Users located in European Union member states may be subject to VAT on their purchases. Provider may collect VAT at the applicable rate based on User's location. Users with valid VAT registration numbers may request zero-rating by providing their VAT number, subject to verification through the EU VAT Information Exchange System (VIES).

(d) **Tax Exemption Claims**: If User claims exemption from any Tax, User must provide Provider with valid tax exemption certificates or documentation reasonably satisfactory to Provider before the transaction. Provider is not obligated to honor exemption claims made after payment is processed.

(e) **Withholding Obligations**: If User is required by law to withhold any amount from payment to Provider (e.g., pursuant to withholding tax requirements), User shall: (i) increase the payment to Provider so that Provider receives the full amount due before withholding; (ii) timely remit the withheld amount to the appropriate tax authority; and (iii) promptly provide Provider with official receipts or other documentation evidencing the withholding and remittance.

(f) **Tax Cooperation**: User agrees to provide Provider with any information, documentation, or certifications reasonably requested by Provider to comply with applicable tax laws or to enable Provider to claim tax benefits or exemptions.

## ARTICLE 6: ACCOUNT INACTIVITY, DORMANCY, AND CLOSURE

### 6.1 Definitions and Inactivity Thresholds

**(a) "Inactive Account" Defined**: An Account is deemed "Inactive" when User has not performed any Qualifying Activity (as defined below) for three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive calendar days.

**(b) "Qualifying Activity" Defined**: For purposes of preventing Account inactivity, the following actions constitute "Qualifying Activity" that resets the inactivity timer to zero:

(i) Making any authenticated API request to any Service endpoint;

(ii) Logging into the User dashboard through the Service website or application;

(iii) Modifying any Account settings, including password changes, email address updates, or notification preferences;

(iv) Purchasing Credits;

(v) Communicating with Provider's support team via email or support ticket system;

(vi) Performing API key regeneration or rotation;

(vii) Any other action requiring authentication and interaction with Provider's systems that Provider reasonably determines constitutes active use.

The following actions do NOT constitute Qualifying Activity:

(i) Merely receiving emails from Provider (User must affirmatively interact with the Account);

(ii) Having a positive Credit balance (unused Credits alone do not constitute activity);

(iii) Third parties accessing User's Account or API Keys without User's authorization or knowledge.

**(c) "Dormant Account" Defined**: An Account becomes "Dormant" on the three hundred sixty-sixth (366th) consecutive day of inactivity, at which point the Account becomes subject to the Dormant Account Maintenance Fee as described in Section 6.4.

### 6.2 Inactivity Warning Notifications

When User's Account approaches the inactivity threshold, Provider shall send warning notifications to User's registered email address as follows:

(a) **First Warning**: Sent on Day 335 of consecutive inactivity (thirty (30) days before Dormancy), with subject line "ACCOUNT INACTIVITY WARNING: 30 Days Until Dormancy" or substantially similar language;

(b) **Final Warning**: Sent on Day 358 of consecutive inactivity (seven (7) days before Dormancy), with subject line "URGENT: ACCOUNT BECOMING DORMANT IN 7 DAYS" or substantially similar language.

Each warning notification shall include:

(i) Clear statement that the Account is approaching Dormancy;

(ii) Number of days remaining until Dormancy;

(iii) Explanation of consequences of Dormancy, including Maintenance Fees;

(iv) Instructions for preventing Dormancy by performing Qualifying Activity;

(v) Direct link to the User dashboard where User can log in to reset the inactivity timer;

(vi) Provider's contact information for questions or assistance.

**User's Responsibility Regarding Email Monitoring**: User acknowledges and agrees that:

(i) It is User's sole responsibility to maintain a valid, currently operational email address in User's Account settings;

(ii) It is User's sole responsibility to monitor User's email inbox (including spam/junk folders) for communications from Provider;

(iii) Provider has no obligation to send notifications through any channel other than email to User's registered email address;

(iv) Provider makes commercially reasonable efforts to deliver email notifications but cannot guarantee delivery due to factors outside Provider's control (spam filters, email provider issues, etc.);

(v) Failure to receive email notifications, whether due to User's email provider, User's spam filter settings, User's failure to check email, or any other reason, does NOT excuse User's Account from becoming Dormant or from accruing Maintenance Fees;

(vi) Provider's sending of email notifications (as evidenced by Provider's email server logs) constitutes sufficient notice, regardless of whether User actually reads or receives such emails.

Provider may, in its discretion, send additional reminder notifications through other channels (in-dashboard notifications, SMS if phone number provided, etc.) but is not obligated to do so. Provision of warnings through alternative channels does not create any obligation or expectation of such notifications in the future.

### 6.3 Prevention of Dormancy

User may prevent Account Dormancy at any time prior to Day 366 by simply performing any Qualifying Activity as defined in Section 6.1(b). Upon any Qualifying Activity:

(a) The inactivity timer immediately resets to zero;

(b) The Account is no longer on track toward Dormancy;

(c) No Maintenance Fees are assessed;

(d) User has a new 365-day period before the Account would again approach inactivity.

The simplest methods to prevent Dormancy are:

(i) Making a single API request (which consumes one (1) Credit but resets the timer);

(ii) Logging into the User dashboard, even if only to view Account status.

Provider encourages Users who anticipate extended periods of non-use but wish to preserve their Accounts and Credits to set a recurring calendar reminder to log in at least once every 300-330 days.

### 6.4 Dormant Account Maintenance Fee

**(a) Fee Assessment Trigger**: An Account that has been Inactive for 365 consecutive days becomes Dormant on Day 366, at which point the Account becomes subject to a recurring Monthly Dormant Account Maintenance Fee.

**(b) Fee Amount**: The Monthly Dormant Account Maintenance Fee is Five United States Dollars (US$5.00) per calendar month, which is equivalent to Five Thousand (5,000) Credits at current pricing.

**(c) Fee Deduction Mechanism**: The Maintenance Fee is automatically deducted from User's Credit balance on the first (1st) day of each calendar month while the Account remains Dormant. The first fee assessment occurs on the first day of the month following the month in which the Account became Dormant.

**Example**: If User's Account becomes Dormant on March 15, the first Maintenance Fee is assessed on April 1. If the Account remains Dormant, subsequent fees are assessed on May 1, June 1, and so forth.

**(d) Deduction Priority**: Maintenance Fees are deducted before any other potential Credit usage. If User makes an API request in a Dormant Account, the Maintenance Fee for that month (if not yet deducted) is deducted first, then the API request consumes an additional Credit.

**(e) Insufficient Balance**: If User's Credit balance is insufficient to pay the full Maintenance Fee when it comes due:

(i) All remaining Credits are immediately forfeited and the balance is reduced to zero;

(ii) No partial-month credit or prorated refund is provided;

(iii) The Account is immediately flagged for closure pursuant to Section 6.5(a);

(iv) Provider shall send Account Closure Notice to User's email address (though failure to receive such notice does not affect the closure).

**(f) Fee Continuation**: Maintenance Fees continue to accrue monthly until one of the following occurs:

(i) User performs Qualifying Activity, thereby removing the Account from Dormant status (see Section 6.6);

(ii) User's Credit balance is depleted as described in subsection (e) above;

(iii) User's Account is closed pursuant to Section 6.5;

(iv) User voluntarily closes the Account;

(v) Provider terminates the Account for other reasons.

**(g) Exemption for Low Balance Accounts**: Accounts with a Credit balance below the equivalent of Ten United States Dollars (US$10.00) or Ten Thousand (10,000) Credits at the time Dormancy would otherwise commence are **exempt** from Maintenance Fees. Instead, such low-balance Accounts are subject to immediate closure under Section 6.5(b).

**Rationale**: This exemption exists because assessing fees on very low balances is administratively inefficient and would rapidly deplete the Account anyway.

**(h) No Fee Refund**: Maintenance Fees, once assessed and deducted, are non-refundable under any circumstances, consistent with the general no-refund policy in Article 5.6. This applies even if User subsequently reactivates the Account or disagrees with the fee assessment.

### 6.5 Account Closure Due to Inactivity

User's Account shall be automatically closed (i.e., permanently disabled, with all data subject to deletion) under the following circumstances:

**(a) Depletion of Balance by Maintenance Fees**: If Maintenance Fees deplete User's Credit balance to zero (0) or below, the Account shall be automatically closed within thirty (30) days of balance depletion. Provider shall send an Account Closure Notice via email, though failure to receive such notice does not prevent or invalidate the closure.

**(b) Low Balance at Dormancy Threshold**: If User's Credit balance is less than US$10.00 (or equivalent in Credits) at the moment the Account would otherwise become Dormant (Day 366 of inactivity), the Account shall be automatically closed within thirty (30) days, rather than becoming subject to Maintenance Fees.

**Example**: User has 8,000 Credits (US$8.00 equivalent) and has been inactive for 365 days. On Day 366, rather than assessing a Maintenance Fee that would nearly deplete the Account, Provider simply closes the Account within 30 days.

**(c) Extended Dormancy with Maintenance Fee Payments**: If an Account remains Dormant and continues paying Maintenance Fees for eighteen (18) consecutive months, Provider may, in its discretion, send a Final Notice offering User the option to either reactivate the Account or permanently close it. If User does not respond within thirty (30) days of such notice, Provider may close the Account.

**Effect of Closure**: Upon Account closure due to inactivity:

(i) **API Key Revocation**: All API Keys associated with the Account are immediately and permanently revoked. Any attempted API requests using such keys shall return authentication errors.

(ii) **Credit Forfeiture**: All remaining Credits, if any, are permanently forfeited. User has no claim to the value of forfeited Credits and is not entitled to any refund, credit, or other compensation.

(iii) **Data Handling**: User's Personal Data is handled in accordance with Provider's Privacy Policy and Article 17 of this Agreement. Account closure typically triggers data minimization procedures whereby Personal Data is anonymized or deleted (subject to retention requirements for Transaction Records and other legally required data).

(iv) **Reactivation Window**: User may request Account reactivation within ninety (90) days of closure by contacting Provider at support@mumin.ink. Reactivation is subject to Provider's approval in its sole discretion and may require identity re-verification. Beyond the 90-day window, reactivation is generally not possible, and User must create a new Account.

### 6.6 Reactivation of Dormant Accounts

A Dormant Account that has not yet been closed may be reactivated at any time by User performing any Qualifying Activity as defined in Section 6.1(b). Upon reactivation:

(a) The Account status immediately changes from "Dormant" to "Active";

(b) The inactivity timer resets to zero, giving User a new 365-day period;

(c) No further Maintenance Fees are assessed unless the Account becomes Dormant again in the future;

(d) Any Maintenance Fees already paid are not refunded;

(e) The Account functions normally with full access to all purchased Credits (minus any Maintenance Fees already deducted).

**Partial Month Fee Credit**: If User reactivates an Account on any day other than the 1st of the month, User is not charged a prorated Maintenance Fee for that partial month. Maintenance Fees are only assessed on the 1st day of each full month of Dormancy.

**Example**: User's Account is Dormant. Maintenance Fee was deducted on June 1. User reactivates the Account on June 15 by logging into the dashboard. No fee is assessed for the June 1-15 period. If User remains active, no July 1 fee is assessed either. If User becomes inactive again and hits Dormancy again, a new fee cycle begins.

### 6.7 Rationale for Inactivity Policy

This inactivity policy serves multiple legitimate business purposes:

(a) **Infrastructure Cost Recovery**: Dormant Accounts consume database storage, backup resources, and infrastructure capacity without generating any corresponding revenue or providing any value to User. The Maintenance Fee helps offset these costs.

(b) **Resource Optimization**: Closing abandoned Accounts allows Provider to optimize database performance, reduce storage requirements, and allocate resources to active Users who derive value from the Service.

(c) **Security and Data Minimization**: Inactive Accounts represent security risks (orphaned credentials that may be compromised) and data minimization obligations under privacy regulations like GDPR encourage deletion of data no longer needed for active service provision.

(d) **Fraud Prevention**: Long-dormant Accounts are sometimes reactivated by fraudsters who have gained unauthorized access. Closing such Accounts reduces this risk.

(e) **Customer Communication**: The inactivity policy creates touchpoints for Provider to communicate with Users who may have forgotten about their Accounts, allowing them to use their Credits or consciously decide to close their Accounts.

User acknowledges that this policy is commercially reasonable and industry-standard practice for pay-as-you-go services with prepaid balances.

(f) **Commercial Applications**: Developing and operating commercial applications that incorporate hadith Content, subject to the restrictions in Section 7.2(d) regarding competing services. Examples include Islamic apps with subscription models, apps with advertising, or apps with in-app purchases.

### 7.2 Prohibited Uses

User shall NOT use the Service, directly or indirectly, for any of the following purposes or in any of the following manners:

**(a) Database Replication and Systematic Extraction**:

(i) Systematically downloading, extracting, scraping, or retrieving substantial portions of the hadith database with the intent or effect of replicating, mirroring, or recreating Provider's database;

(ii) Using automated tools, bots, scripts, crawlers, spiders, or any other automated means to systematically access or download Content in bulk quantities;

(iii) Implementing scrapers that iterate through hadith IDs sequentially or otherwise attempt to enumerate and download the entire database;

(iv) Making API requests at high volume with the primary purpose of data extraction rather than legitimate application functionality serving end users;

## ARTICLE 8: RATE LIMITS AND USAGE RESTRICTIONS

### 8.1 Implementation of Rate Limits

To ensure fair resource allocation among all Users and to protect Service infrastructure from abuse, Provider implements rate limits that restrict the number of API requests User may make within specified time periods. Rate limits are strictly enforced through automated systems and are NON-NEGOTIABLE except through custom enterprise agreements negotiated separately in writing.

### 8.2 Types of Rate Limits

Provider implements multiple categories of rate limits, which operate independently and cumulatively:

**(a) Per-API-Key Rate Limits**: Limits applied based on the specific API Key making the request. As of the Effective Date: Maximum of one hundred (100) requests per minute per API Key.

**(b) Per-IP-Address Rate Limits**: Limits applied based on the originating IP address of the request. As of the Effective Date: Maximum of one thousand (1,000) requests per hour per IP address.

**(c) Daily Request Limits (Account Age-Based)**: Limits applied based on the age of User's Account, designed to prevent fraud and abuse by new accounts:

| Account Age | Daily Request Limit |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Days 0-7 (Week 1) | 500 requests/day |
| Days 8-30 (Weeks 2-4) | 2,000 requests/day |
| Days 31+ (Month 2+) | 10,000 requests/day |

These daily limits apply regardless of User's Credit balance and cannot be circumvented by purchasing additional Credits.

**(d) Burst Limits**: Short-term limits on rapid-fire requests to prevent abuse: Maximum of ten (10) requests per second per API Key.

User's actual allowed request rate at any given moment is the MINIMUM of all applicable limits. For example, even if User's API Key limit allows 100 requests/minute, User cannot make more than 500 requests in a single day if User's Account is only 3 days old.

### 8.3 Rate Limit Modifications

Provider reserves the unilateral right to modify, increase, decrease, add, or remove rate limits at any time without advance notice. Rate limit changes may be implemented:

(a) Globally across all Users;

(b) For specific Account tiers or pricing plans (if implemented in the future);

(c) On a per-Account basis for Users demonstrating trustworthy usage patterns (increases) or abusive patterns (decreases);

(d) Temporarily in response to infrastructure issues, security threats, or unusual traffic patterns.

Changes to rate limits do not constitute modification of this Agreement requiring notice under Article 19.

### 8.4 Rate Limit Enforcement and Consequences

When User exceeds a rate limit, the following enforcement mechanisms apply:

**(a) HTTP 429 Response**: API requests exceeding rate limits receive an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" response with headers indicating:

- The rate limit that was exceeded;
- The time period applicable to the limit;
- The time at which the limit resets (UTC timestamp);
- Recommended retry-after delay.

**(b) Request Rejection**: Requests exceeding rate limits are rejected and NOT processed. No Credit is deducted for rejected requests.

**(c) Temporary Throttling**: Repeated rate limit violations may trigger additional temporary throttling, reducing User's effective rate limit for a cooldown period (typically 1-24 hours).

**(d) Account Suspension**: Systematic attempts to circumvent or overwhelm rate limits (e.g., through IP rotation, multiple API Keys, distributed requests) may result in Account suspension or termination pursuant to Article 7.3.

### 8.5 Graduated Limits Rationale

The graduated daily limits based on Account age serve critical anti-fraud purposes:

(a) **Chargeback Window Protection**: Payment processors typically allow chargebacks within 60-180 days of transaction. Graduated limits prevent fraudsters from purchasing Credits, immediately extracting the entire database, and then initiating chargebacks.

(b) **Trust Building**: Accounts that remain active and in good standing over time demonstrate legitimacy and earn higher limits as a reward for trustworthy usage.

(c) **Resource Protection**: New accounts represent the highest fraud risk, so limiting their immediate access protects infrastructure for legitimate long-term Users.

(d) **Abuse Detection Window**: Lower initial limits provide a window during which Provider can detect abusive patterns before significant damage occurs.

User acknowledges that these graduated limits are commercially reasonable and necessary for Service security and sustainability.

## ARTICLE 9: FRAUD DETECTION, MONITORING, AND SECURITY MEASURES

### 9.1 Provider's Monitoring Rights and Obligations

Provider has both the right and the obligation to monitor Service usage for security, fraud prevention, abuse detection, and quality assurance purposes. User expressly acknowledges and consents to such monitoring. Specifically, Provider continuously monitors, logs, analyzes, and retains the following categories of data:

**(a) Request Metadata**: For each API request, Provider logs: timestamp (UTC, millisecond precision); originating IP address; API Key used; endpoint accessed; HTTP method; response status code; response time; payload size; user agent string; referer header; and any error messages.

**(b) Usage Patterns**: Provider analyzes request patterns to detect: sequential hadith ID enumeration (scraper pattern); abnormally high request rates; unusual temporal patterns (e.g., requests occurring at perfectly regular intervals indicating bot behavior); access to rarely-used endpoints; geographic anomalies; and other statistically unusual behaviors.

**(c) Device and Network Data**: Provider collects and analyzes: IP address geolocation and ASN; IP reputation scores from third-party threat intelligence feeds; device fingerprints; TLS/SSL handshake parameters; and network path characteristics.

**(d) Authentication Events**: Provider logs all authentication attempts, successful logins, failed logins, password changes, API Key generation/regeneration events, and session management activities.

**(e) Financial Transaction Patterns**: Provider analyzes payment patterns, including: purchase amounts and frequencies; payment method patterns; velocity of Credit consumption; and correlation between payment timing and usage spikes.

### 9.2 Automated Fraud Detection Systems

Provider employs automated fraud detection algorithms and machine learning models that continuously analyze the data described in Section 9.1 to identify potential Fraudulent Activity or Prohibited Uses. These systems may automatically trigger the following actions without human review:

**(a) Fraud Flags**: Marking an Account as potentially fraudulent, which may result in additional scrutiny, manual review requirements, or restrictions on future purchases;

**(b) Rate Limiting**: Imposing stricter rate limits on Accounts exhibiting suspicious patterns;

**(c) CAPTCHA Challenges**: Requiring User to complete CAPTCHA challenges before processing requests, to distinguish human users from bots;

**(d) Payment Method Restrictions**: Declining certain payment methods or requiring alternative payment methods for Accounts flagged as high-risk;

**(e) Temporary Holds**: Placing temporary holds on newly purchased Credits (preventing immediate use) for high-risk transactions, typically 24-72 hours;

**(f) Automatic Suspension**: Immediately suspending Accounts that exhibit patterns strongly indicative of abuse, pending manual review.

User acknowledges that automated systems may occasionally produce false positives. If User believes User's Account has been erroneously flagged or restricted, User may contact support@mumin.ink to request manual review. Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to review such requests promptly but is not obligated to provide detailed explanations of its fraud detection methodologies, as such disclosure could enable circumvention.

### 9.3 Device Fingerprinting Technology

Provider employs device fingerprinting technology to generate unique identifiers for each device accessing the Service. Device fingerprinting involves collecting and algorithmically processing the following data points:

(a) IP address and network characteristics;
(b) User agent string (browser, OS, version);
(c) HTTP headers (Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.);
(d) Screen resolution, color depth, pixel ratio;
(e) Timezone and system time offset;
(f) Installed fonts (via CSS font enumeration);
(g) Canvas fingerprint (unique hash generated from HTML5 Canvas rendering);
(h) WebGL fingerprint (GPU and graphics driver information);
(i) Audio context fingerprint (unique characteristics of audio processing);
(j) Browser plugins and extensions (where detectable);
(k) Hardware concurrency (CPU cores);
(l) Device memory;
(m) Touch support and multi-touch capabilities;
(n) Battery status API data (where available);
(o) Network connection type and estimated bandwidth.

The collected data points are processed through a hashing algorithm to generate a probabilistically unique device fingerprint. This fingerprint enables Provider to:

(i) Detect when multiple Accounts are created or accessed from the same device (indicative of multi-accounting or ban evasion);

(ii) Link seemingly unrelated Accounts operated by the same individual or entity;

(iii) Identify suspicious access patterns, such as a single device accessing hundreds of different Accounts;

(iv) Detect when User's Account is accessed from a new, previously unseen device (potential Account compromise);

(v) Enhance security by implementing device-based authentication factors.

**User Consent and Acknowledgment**: By accepting this Agreement and using the Service, User expressly consents to device fingerprinting and acknowledges that:

(i) Device fingerprinting is a critical security and fraud prevention measure;

(ii) Device fingerprints may be retained indefinitely for security purposes;

(iii) Device fingerprint data may be shared with fraud prevention services or law enforcement where legally required;

(iv) Provider's use of device fingerprinting complies with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR (as device fingerprinting is necessary for Provider's legitimate interests in security and fraud prevention under GDPR Article 6(1)(f)).

### 9.4 Honeypot Endpoints and Trap Mechanisms

Provider may deploy "honeypot" endpoints—API endpoints that are not documented, not publicly disclosed, and serve no legitimate user purpose—for the purpose of detecting automated scrapers, bots, and abusive access patterns.

Accessing honeypot endpoints constitutes strong evidence that User is engaging in systematic scraping or is using automated tools that blindly enumerate all possible API endpoints. Access to honeypot endpoints may result in:

(a) Immediate Account suspension;
(b) Permanent Account termination;
(c) IP address blacklisting;
(d) Reporting to abuse prevention databases.

User is hereby put on notice that honeypot endpoints exist and that accessing undocumented endpoints constitutes violation of this Agreement.

### 9.5 Third-Party Fraud Prevention Services

Provider may share User data with third-party fraud prevention and abuse detection services, including but not limited to: Stripe Radar (for payment fraud detection); MaxMind (for IP geolocation and fraud scoring); Sift (for fraud detection); Cloudflare (for DDoS protection and bot detection); and similar services.

Such sharing is conducted pursuant to Provider's Privacy Policy and is limited to data necessary for fraud prevention purposes. User consents to such sharing by accepting this Agreement.

### 9.6 Security Incident Response

If Provider detects evidence of Account compromise, unauthorized access, credential theft, or other security incidents affecting User's Account, Provider may:

(a) Immediately revoke User's API Keys and require regeneration of new keys;
(b) Force password reset and require User to establish a new password;
(c) Suspend the Account pending User verification of identity;
(d) Notify User via email of the suspected security incident;
(e) Request that User complete enhanced verification procedures;
(f) Implement additional security measures such as two-factor authentication requirements.

Provider is not liable for any losses, damages, or disruptions resulting from security incident response measures, even if such measures are later determined to have been triggered by false positives or non-malicious activity.

(h) Wasted time, resources, or development efforts.

User specifically waives any right to claim damages, refunds, credits, or other compensation based on Service availability issues. The exclusive remedy for Service interruptions is Service restoration when feasible, without any compensation.

### 11.4 No Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Provider does NOT offer any Service Level Agreement, uptime guarantee, availability commitment, or performance guarantee. This Agreement specifically and intentionally excludes any SLA terms.

If User requires guaranteed uptime or performance commitments, User must negotiate a separate enterprise agreement with Provider, which would supersede this Agreement's provisions regarding availability.

### 11.5 Right to Modify or Discontinue Service

Provider reserves the absolute and unilateral right to:

(a) Modify, update, alter, or change any aspect of the Service, including features, functionality, API endpoints, data formats, authentication methods, or technical implementation;

(b) Add new features or capabilities;

(c) Remove, deprecate, or discontinue existing features or functionality;

(d) Temporarily or permanently discontinue the Service entirely;

All such modifications may be implemented at any time, with or without advance notice, without any liability to User, and without any obligation to provide refunds or compensation.

User's continued use of the Service after any such modification constitutes acceptance of the modifications.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

**(a) Implied Warranty of Merchantability**: Provider makes no warranty that the Service is of merchantable quality or fit for commercial purposes.

**(b) Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: Provider makes no warranty that the Service is suitable or adequate for User's specific intended purpose, use case, or application.

**(c) Implied Warranty of Title and Non-Infringement**: While Provider represents that it has the right to license the Service, Provider makes no warranty that User's use of the Service will not infringe third-party rights.

**(d) Warranties of Accuracy or Reliability**: Provider makes no warranty that Content is accurate, reliable, authentic, complete, current, or error-free.

**(e) Warranties of Uninterrupted or Error-Free Service**: Provider makes no warranty that the Service will operate without interruption, errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities.

**(h) Warranties of Availability**: Provider makes no warranty regarding Service uptime, availability, or accessibility at any particular time.

**(j) Any Other Warranties**: All other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or arising from course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance, are expressly disclaimed and excluded.

### 12.2 No Warranty on Hadith Content

**PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING THE RELIGIOUS, SCHOLARLY, OR SPIRITUAL CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE.**

User acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) **Historical Nature**: Hadith texts are historical religious materials compiled by classical Islamic scholars over many centuries. Provider is not the author or originator of these texts.

(b) **Translation Variability**: Hadith translations provided through the Service are produced by various translators and scholars. Translation involves interpretation, and different translators may render the same Arabic text differently. Provider makes no representation that any particular translation is the most accurate, authoritative, or appropriate.

(c) **Authentication Disputes**: While hadith collections provided through the Service (such as Sahih al-Bukhari) are generally recognized as authentic by mainstream Islamic scholarship, there exist scholarly debates and differences of opinion regarding hadith authentication, chain of narration analysis, and interpretation.

(d) **No Religious Advice**: Provider does not provide religious guidance, Islamic legal rulings (fatawa), spiritual counseling, or personal religious advice. The Service merely provides access to historical texts.

(e) **Consult Qualified Scholars**: For matters of religious importance, Islamic jurisprudence, personal religious questions, or application of hadith to specific situations, User must consult qualified Islamic scholars, imams, or religious authorities in User's community.

(f) **Independent Verification**: User is responsible for independently verifying any information obtained from the Service that User intends to rely upon for religious practice, teaching, or scholarly work.

(g) **Contextual Understanding**: Hadith texts must be understood within their proper historical, linguistic, and jurisprudential context. Provider's Service does not provide comprehensive context, commentary, or scholarly apparatus necessary for deep understanding.

### 12.3 "AS-IS" Acknowledgment

User expressly acknowledges and confirms that:

(a) User is acquiring access to the Service "AS-IS" with all faults, defects, errors, and limitations;

(b) User has not relied upon any representation, statement, warranty, or promise made by Provider beyond what is expressly stated in this Article 12;

(c) User assumes all risks associated with use of the Service;

(d) User is solely responsible for determining whether the Service is suitable for User's purposes;

(e) Provider has made no promises or guarantees beyond those explicitly stated in this Agreement.

### 12.4 Limitations on Disclaimer

Nothing in this Article 12 excludes or limits any warranty, condition, or right that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable mandatory law. For example, certain consumer protection laws in some jurisdictions may provide minimum warranty rights that cannot be waived by contract. If such laws apply to User, those minimum rights are preserved notwithstanding this disclaimer.

However, User acknowledges that such mandatory law protections are narrow exceptions and that the broad disclaimers set forth in this Article 12 apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

---

## ARTICLE 13: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES CAP

### 13.1 Maximum Aggregate Liability Cap

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PROVIDER'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO USER FOR ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, OR CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR USER'S USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF:**

**(a) TEN UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10.00); OR**

**(b) THE TOTAL AMOUNT USER PAID TO PROVIDER IN THE THIRTY (30) CALENDAR DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.**

**Clarifying Examples**:

- If User has paid $100 in total lifetime but only $20 in the last 30 days before a claim, Provider's maximum liability is $20.

- If User has paid $5 in the last 30 days, Provider's maximum liability is $10 (the greater of $10 or $5).

- If User has paid $0 in the last 30 days (using only previously purchased Credits), Provider's maximum liability is $10.

This cap applies **collectively and cumulatively** to all claims. If User asserts multiple claims, the cap applies to the sum total of all such claims, not to each claim individually.

### 13.2 Exclusion of Consequential and Indirect Damages

**IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE TO USER FOR ANY:**

**(a) Indirect Damages**: Damages that arise indirectly from the breach or wrong, rather than as a direct and immediate result.

**(b) Incidental Damages**: Damages incidental to or consequential upon Provider's breach, including costs of cover or other collateral expenses.

**(c) Consequential Damages**: Damages that flow from special circumstances of User's situation, including but not limited to: lost profits or revenue; lost business opportunities; loss of anticipated savings; loss of business, contracts, or goodwill; reputational damage; loss of data or information; costs of procuring substitute services; business interruption losses.

**(d) Special Damages**: Damages arising from special circumstances not generally encountered by other users.

**(e) Exemplary, Punitive, or Multiplied Damages**: Any form of damages intended to punish or make an example, or any statutory provision that multiplies compensatory damages.

**This exclusion applies EVEN IF Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether the claim is based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, statute, or any other legal theory.**

The only damages for which Provider may potentially be liable (subject to the cap in Section 13.1) are direct, actual, proven compensatory damages that do not fall within the excluded categories above.

### 13.3 Essential Nature of Limitations

User expressly acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) The limitations and exclusions in this Article 13 are ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS of the bargain between User and Provider;

(b) Provider would not provide the Service at the current pricing (or at all) without these limitations;

(c) The limitations reflect a fair and reasonable allocation of risk between the parties given the nature of the Service (digital, prepaid, low-cost);

(d) User has had the opportunity to obtain insurance or other risk mitigation for damages excluded under this Article;

(e) If any limitation or exclusion in this Article 13 is found invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, such finding does not affect the validity of other limitations, and the invalid limitation shall be modified to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 13.4 Limitation Application Across Multiple Claims

If User asserts multiple claims arising from the same facts or related circumstances (e.g., breach of contract + negligence + fraud, all relating to the same underlying Service issue), such claims shall be treated as a single unified claim for purposes of the liability cap in Section 13.1.

User may not circumvent the liability cap by bringing multiple separate lawsuits, arbitrations, or proceedings. All related claims must be brought in a single proceeding, and the liability cap applies to the aggregate recovery across all such related claims.

### 13.5 No Liability for Third-Party Actions or Claims

Provider is not liable for:

(a) Actions, errors, omissions, or misconduct of third parties, including payment processors, hosting providers, CDN services, internet service providers, or any other third-party service providers;

(b) Third-party claims asserted against User by User's customers, end users, partners, or any other parties arising from User's use of the Service;

(c) Losses resulting from User's failure to implement adequate security measures, User's disclosure of credentials, or User's negligent or wrongful conduct;

(d) Content provided by third parties, including historical hadith texts compiled by classical scholars;

(e) User's misunderstanding, misuse, or misapplication of the Service or Content.

### 13.6 Force Majeure—No Liability for Events Beyond Control

Provider is not liable for any failure or delay in performing obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event as defined in Article 1.1.

Force Majeure Events include but are not limited to: acts of God; natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions); severe weather; epidemics or pandemics; war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies; terrorism; civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection; government action, laws, or regulations; embargo, sanctions, export controls; strikes or labor disputes; telecommunications infrastructure failures; internet backbone failures; power grid failures; failures of third-party service providers; cyberattacks or DDoS attacks; and any other event beyond Provider's reasonable control.

Upon occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Provider's performance obligations are suspended for the duration of the event. Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as practicable after the Force Majeure Event ends, but User waives any right to damages, refunds, or compensation arising from Force Majeure Events.

### 13.7 Limitations Survival and Enforceability

The limitations in this Article 13 survive:

(a) Expiration or termination of this Agreement;

(b) Any breach of this Agreement by either party;

(c) User's closure of Account;

(d) Provider's discontinuation of the Service.

These limitations remain enforceable indefinitely with respect to any claims arising during the period when this Agreement was in effect.

### 13.8 Jurisdictional Variations

Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages (e.g., consumer protection laws in certain countries/states prohibit exclusion of liability for personal injury, fraud, or gross negligence).

To the extent any portion of this Article 13 is found unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction:

(a) The unenforceable portion shall be severed;

(b) The remaining limitations shall remain in full force;

(c) The unenforceable limitation shall be interpreted as narrowly as possible consistent with applicable law to preserve maximum limitation of liability.

Provider specifically disclaims liability to the maximum extent permitted by the law applicable to User.

### 14.1 User's Indemnification Obligation

(c) **No Settlement Without Consent**: User shall not settle any claim, admit liability, or make any statement that could bind or prejudice Indemnified Parties without Provider's prior written consent, which may be withheld in Provider's sole discretion.

(b) Not make any public statements regarding the claim without Provider's prior written approval;

## ARTICLE 15: DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

### 15.1 Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan, without regard to its conflict of laws principles that would require application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

**Mandatory Law Exception**: Notwithstanding the foregoing choice of law, nothing in this Agreement excludes, limits, or waives User's rights under mandatory provisions of User's local law that cannot be waived by contract, including but not limited to: consumer protection laws, data protection regulations (such as GDPR for EU residents), and other mandatory legal protections.

In the event of conflict between Uzbekistan law and User's mandatory local law, the mandatory local law prevails solely to the extent of the conflict and solely with respect to rights that cannot be waived by contract.

### 15.2 Agreement to Arbitrate All Disputes

**USER AND PROVIDER MUTUALLY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, OR CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, USER'S USE OF THE SERVICE, OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USER AND PROVIDER (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER THE CLAIMS ARISE DURING OR AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT) SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT.**

**(e) Seat/Location of Arbitration**: The legal seat of arbitration shall be Tashkent, Uzbekistan. However, the arbitration may be conducted online via video conference, document exchange, and electronic communications, which is strongly encouraged for cost efficiency.

**(f) Language**: The arbitration shall be conducted in English or Russian, as mutually agreed by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the arbitrator shall select the language.

**(g) Confidentiality**: The arbitration proceedings, including all submissions, hearings, and the award, shall be confidential. Neither party shall disclose the existence, content, or results of the arbitration without the other party's prior written consent, except: (i) to legal and financial advisors under confidentiality obligations; (ii) as required by law or court order; (iii) to enforce the arbitral award; or (iv) as permitted by the UNCITRAL Rules.

**(h) Discovery**: Discovery shall be limited to what is reasonable and necessary for the issues in dispute, as determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may order production of documents and electronic discovery but shall avoid the expansive discovery typical in U.S. litigation.

**(i) Evidence and Hearings**: The arbitrator shall determine the admissibility, relevance, and weight of evidence. Hearings may be conducted in-person, by video conference, or by written submission, as the arbitrator determines appropriate.

**(j) Award**: The arbitrator shall issue a written award with findings of fact and conclusions of law. The award is final and binding on both parties and is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**(k) Standard of Review**: There is no appeal from the arbitral award except as provided in the New York Convention or applicable arbitration law (which allows challenges only for very limited grounds such as corruption or excess of jurisdiction).

### 15.4 Arbitration Costs and Fees

**(a) Filing Fees**: Provider and User shall each pay one-half (50%) of the arbitration filing fees and administrative costs charged by the arbitration administrator.

**(b) Arbitrator Fees**: Provider and User shall each pay one-half (50%) of the arbitrator's fees and expenses.

**(c) Attorney's Fees**: Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs, except:

(ii) If User is a consumer in a jurisdiction where Consumer law requires Provider to pay certain arbitration costs, such mandatory law provisions shall apply.

**(d) Fee Waiver for Low-Value Claims**: For claims valued at US$10,000 or less, if User demonstrates financial hardship, Provider may in its sole discretion waive or reduce User's share of arbitration costs.

### 15.5 Class Action Waiver—Individual Disputes Only

**USER AND PROVIDER MUTUALLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.**

Specifically:

(a) **No Class Arbitrations**: There shall be no class arbitrations, consolidated arbitrations, or representative arbitrations. Each User must arbitrate claims individually.

(b) **No Class Actions in Court**: To the extent any claim is permitted to proceed in court (pursuant to exceptions in Section 15.8), there shall be no class actions, consolidated actions, or representative actions.

(c) **No Consolidation**: The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or parties without mutual written consent of all affected parties.

(d) **Severability of Class Waiver**: If the class action waiver is found unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, such claim or relief shall be severed and proceeded in court, while arbitrable claims proceed in arbitration.

(e) **Waiver of Rights**: User expressly waives any right to bring or participate in class actions, representative actions, collective actions, or consolidated proceedings of any kind.

### 15.6 Small Claims Court Exception

Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim meets the jurisdictional requirements of such court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Once a small claims court action is filed, the parties may not subsequently demand arbitration of that claim.

### 15.7 Informal Dispute Resolution Prerequisite

Before initiating arbitration or small claims court action, the party asserting a claim must first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by providing written notice to the other party describing: (a) the nature of the claim; (b) the factual basis for the claim; (c) the relief sought; and (d) User's Account email address (for claims by User) or contact information (for claims by Provider).

**Notice Addresses**:
- Claims by User against Provider: legal@mumin.ink, subject line "FORMAL DISPUTE NOTICE"
- Claims by Provider against User: User's registered email address

The parties shall then negotiate in good faith for sixty (60) days to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days, either party may initiate arbitration.

Failure to comply with this informal dispute resolution prerequisite may result in dismissal of the arbitration demand without prejudice, requiring the claiming party to restart the process.

### 15.8 Exceptions to Arbitration—Equitable Relief

Either party may seek the following forms of relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without being required to arbitrate:

(a) **Injunctive Relief**: Preliminary or permanent injunctions to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights, misappropriation of trade secrets, or ongoing breaches of confidentiality obligations.

(b) **Specific Performance**: Orders requiring specific performance of obligations that cannot be adequately remedied by monetary damages.

(c) **Temporary Restraining Orders**: Emergency relief necessary to prevent irreparable harm pending arbitration.

Such court actions may proceed simultaneously with arbitration of other issues. The existence of such court proceedings does not waive the agreement to arbitrate other claims.

### 15.9 Waiver of Jury Trial

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, USER AND PROVIDER EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PROCEEDS IN COURT.**

### 15.10 Enforceability Under the New York Convention

This arbitration agreement is governed by the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (commonly known as the "New York Convention"), to which both the Republic of Uzbekistan and over 160 other countries are signatories.

Arbitral awards issued pursuant to this Agreement are enforceable in all New York Convention signatory countries, providing User with an internationally enforceable remedy if Provider fails to comply with an award, and providing Provider with an internationally enforceable remedy if User fails to comply with an award.

### 15.11 Severability of Arbitration Provisions

If any portion of this Article 15 is found illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed, and the remainder of this Article shall remain in full force and effect. If the class action waiver (Section 15.5) is found unenforceable, any class claims shall be litigated in court, while individual claims shall be arbitrated.

If the entire arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, subject to Section 15.12.

### 15.12 Exclusive Jurisdiction (If Arbitration Unenforceable)

If, and only if, the arbitration agreement in this Article 15 is found wholly unenforceable, then the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan for resolution of any disputes. User waives any objection to jurisdiction or venue in such courts.
